# Module 3: Orchestration and ML Pipelines

See this [GitHub page](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp/tree/main/03-orchestration) 
on [DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp).

In module 3, we will learn to use Prefect to orchestrate and observe our ML workflows.

## 3.1 Introdution to Workflow Orchestration

Key Takeaways:

* The video discusses orchestration and machine learning (ML) pipelines with Prefect
* It introduces the concept of workflow orchestration and explains its importance for ML projects
* The challenges of working with complex systems are discussed, and how orchestration can help manage these challenges
* The benefits of using an orchestration tool like Prefect are also highlighted, including increased efficiency and reduced errors
* The video then dives into the Prefect UI tools and shows how they can help manage workflows through task visualization, error handling, and monitoring
* The video is a useful resource for anyone looking to learn more about workflow orchestration and how it can improve efficiency in ML pipelines.

You might have an MLOps workflow that looks like this.

You could have:

* a database that retrieves data
* this could be picked up by a python script using pandas code to clean it up
* data is saved in a parquet file as a checkpoint, maybe readed back later
* scikit-learn used for engineering some features or running some models
* XGBoost to run a model
* MLflow can track anything saved by a database and information is written back and forth
* finally that your model is served via a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) or something like [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/lo/)

We can have points of failure at many different parts of the workflow.

If you give an MLOps engineer a job...

* Could you just set up this pipeline to train this model?
* Could you set up logging?
* Could you do it every day?
* Could you make it retry if it fails?
* Could you send me a message when it succeeds?
* Could you visualize the dependencies?
* Could you add caching?
* Could you add collaborators to run ad hoc - who don't code?

What is Prefect?<br>
Itâ€™s a flexible framework to build, reliably execute and observe your dataflow while supporting a wide variety of execution and data access patterns.<br>
See [Why Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/guide/blog/why-prefect/) from Anna Geller.

### Review: Prefect UI tools for complex systems and ML workflows

> [05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqb7wyaNF08&t=315s) - Review: Prefect UI tools for complex systems and ML workflows.

In the Prefect UI you can quickly set up notifications, visualize run history, and schedule your dataflows.

Prefect provides tools for working with comple systems so you can stop wondering about your workflows.





## 3.2 Introduction to Prefect

:movie_camera: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTUBTvXvXvM&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hIUISrluw_A7wDSmfOhErJK&index=17).

Key Takeaways:
- The video is about Prefect and its various components.
- The video will provide an overview of Prefect terminology and show how to configure a local database.
- The process of setting up the environment and running scripts on the Prefect server will be demonstrated.
- The video will also show how to use retry logic and the workflow UI.
- Flow runs and logs in Prefect will be reviewed towards the end of the video.
- The video is suitable for those interested in learning more about Prefect and its capabilities.

### Introduction to Prefect and its components

In this section we will see how regular python code can be converted into a perfect script and
we will run our own prefect server locally and run scripts on the server.

Goals:

* Clone GitHub repository
* Setup a conda environment
* Start a Prefect server
* Run a Prefect flow
* Checkout Prefect UI

## 3.3 Prefect Workflow

## 3.4 Deploying Your Workflow

## 3.5 Working with Deployments

## 3.6 Prefect Cloud (optional)

## 3.7 Homework

Coming soon!

## Quick setup

### Install packages

In a conda environment with Python 3.10.12 or similar, install all package dependencies with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp.git
cd mlops-zoomcamp
cd 03-orchestration 
conda create -n prefect-env python=3.10
conda activate prefect-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start the Prefect server locally

Create another window and activate your conda environment. Start the Prefect API server locally with

```bash
prefect server start
``` 

### Alternative to self-hosted server use Prefect Cloud for added capabilties

Signup and use for free at https://app.prefect.cloud

Authenticate through the terminal with

```bash
prefect cloud login
```

Use your [Prefect profile](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/settings/) to switch between a self-hosted server and Cloud.
